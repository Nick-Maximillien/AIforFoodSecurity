NOTES TO RESEARCHERS

This experiment trains a YOLOv8n model on crop disease images (maize classes).  
The objective is to benchmark the viability of computer vision for field-level crop diagnostics.

1. Dataset
   - Source: Curated crop_data folder on Google Drive
   - Classes (4):
       0: Maize Blight
       1: Maize Rust
       2: Maize Gray Leaf Spot
       3: Maize Healthy
   - Split:
       train/   (images + labels)
       val/     (images + labels)
       test/    (images + labels)

2. Training Environment
   - Google Colab with GPU runtime
   - ultralytics v8 (YOLOv8n pretrained backbone)
   - PyTorch with CUDA acceleration

3. Training Parameters
   - Model: yolov8n.pt (pretrained)
   - Epochs: 50
   - Image size: 640 Ã— 640
   - Batch size: 16
   - Workers: 2
   - Run name: train_crops

4. Outputs
   - Training logs in /runs/detect/train_crops
   - Metrics: precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95
   - Best weights: best.pt (auto-saved)
   - Last weights: last.pt

5. Next Steps
   - Evaluate on held-out test set
   - Compare lightweight YOLOv8n with larger variants (YOLOv8s/m)
   - Investigate augmentation strategies to improve robustness
   - Document per-class performance
